Technical violations are minor infractions like missing a meeting, failing to pay a fine, or breaking curfew. Chadarion missed a probation check-in after his son accidentally threw his phone in the toilet. For that, he was sent to the infamous Parchman prison, where he tragically took his life 13 days later due to abuse. The current probation system fails to protect public safety, wastes taxpayer dollars, and traps individuals in a cycle of punishment. No one should die over a missed call.

There, Wallace \"Wallo267\" Peeples stood alongside many, witnessing the injustice firsthand. That pivotal moment, along with the unwavering commitment of Meek Mill, Michael Rubin, and Jay-Z, gave birth to REFORM Alliance. Five years later our mission is clear. We aim to transform probation and parole by changing laws, systems, and culture to create real pathways to work and well-being. We work to replace America's criminal justice system with a restorative approach that is fair, accountable, and invested in rehabilitation. Our goal is for people to reenter society with dignity, create meaningful pathways to work, and equip them with the tools to succeed, all while making families and communities safer and stronger. Today, we embark on a new chapter with immense pride. We're thrilled to announce Wallace \"Wallo267\" Peeples as our new Chief Marketing Officer! Wallace's story resonates deeply with REFORM's core values. His journey, marked by both struggle and strength, embodies the transformative power of second chances. His voice, amplified by his platform, is a powerful tool to champion our mission. As CMO, Wallace will be the driving force behind amplifying REFORM's message, mobilizing support, and driving tangible change in our justice system. His leadership, combined with his unique skills will bring our mission to an even wider audience.

      "text": "Here's a fact: access to higher education reduces the likelihood of individuals returning to prison. But here's another fact: most individuals trapped in the system are not afforded the chance to pursue higher education. Thankfully, there are some incredible programs that exist to bridge this gap while breaking down harmful barriers and stigmas - like the @iuindianapolis class. This unique class brings together campus students studying criminal justice and impacted individuals. They're not only discussing topics like race, racism, sexuality, implicit bias, religion, and politics but also sharing their personal experiences. Our brilliant Indiana state organizer Maranda Williams (@randa019) came to learn more about the program and discuss the reforms we're working to pass in Indiana. Maranda Williams leads the Indiana Secure Communities coalition: a diverse coalition of reentry providers, academics, faith leaders, directly impacted individuals, public servants, advocates, and employers working to improve Indiana's criminal justice system. #criminaljusticereform #changethesystemtogether #indianacheck #indianauniversity #reform #criminaljusticemajor ",

Technical violations are minor infractions like missing a meeting, failing to pay a fine, or breaking curfew. Chadarion missed a probation check-in after his son accidentally threw his phone in the toilet. For that, he was sent to the infamous Parchman prison, where he tragically took his life 13 days later due to abuse. The current probation system fails to protect public safety, wastes taxpayer dollars, and traps individuals in a cycle of punishment. No one should die over a missed call. It's time to transform probation and parole into pathways for success.

There, Wallace \"Wallo267\" Peeples stood alongside many, witnessing the injustice firsthand. That pivotal moment, along with the unwavering commitment of Meek Mill, Michael Rubin, and Jay-Z, gave birth to REFORM Alliance. Five years later our mission is clear. We aim to transform probation and parole by changing laws, systems, and culture to create real pathways to work and well-being. We work to replace America's criminal justice system with a restorative approach that is fair, accountable, and invested in rehabilitation. Our goal is for people to reenter society with dignity, create meaningful pathways to work, and equip them with the tools to succeed, all while making families and communities safer and stronger. Today, we embark on a new chapter with immense pride. We're thrilled to announce Wallace \"Wallo267\" Peeples as our new Chief Marketing Officer! Wallace's story resonates deeply with REFORM's core values. His journey, marked by both struggle and strength, embodies the transformative power of second chances. His voice, amplified by his platform, is a powerful tool to champion our mission. As CMO, Wallace will be the driving force behind amplifying REFORM's message, mobilizing support, and driving tangible change in our justice system. His leadership, combined with his unique skills will bring our mission to an even wider audience. Join us in welcoming Wallace @WALLO267  Peeples to the REFORM family! #probationreform #changethesystemtogether #secondchances ",

But here's another fact: most individuals trapped in the system are not afforded the chance to pursue higher education. Thankfully, there are some incredible programs that exist to bridge this gap while breaking down harmful barriers and stigmas - like the @iuindianapolis class. This unique class brings together campus students studying criminal justice and impacted individuals. They're not only discussing topics like race, racism, sexuality, implicit bias, religion, and politics but also sharing their personal experiences. Our brilliant Indiana state organizer Maranda Williams (@randa019) came to learn more about the program and discuss the reforms we're working to pass in Indiana. Maranda Williams leads the Indiana Secure Communities coalition: a diverse coalition of reentry providers, academics, faith leaders, directly impacted individuals, public servants, advocates, and employers working to improve Indiana's criminal justice system. #criminaljusticereform #changethesystemtogether #indianacheck #indianauniversity #reform #criminaljusticemajor ",
